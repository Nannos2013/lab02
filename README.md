So, I begang working on this, adding and completing these files in this order.

1. task.sh
2. 0_xvz
3. date.sh
4. hell-world.sh
5. welcome.sh
6. stdout.txt
7. stderr.txt
8. stdoutandstderr.txt
9. file1.txt
10. function.sh
11. comparison.sh
12. if_else.sh
13. param.sh
14. for.sh
15. items.txt
16. while.sh
17. until.sh
18. backup.sh

then i had to connect all my files via my gespho/lab02 repository. However, I had major issues in committing the files.
They turned green in my git app, but never showed. So i dragged and dropped them all in here through my browser FTP.
